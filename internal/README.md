# LearnVue Internal

This folder contains different helpers to help create content repositories for LearnVue.

## `_templates`

Templates contain the scaffolding for different types of Vue projects. These are used as starting points for the different projects in `demos`. 

The goal is to speed up the process to create projects with sane-defaults. 

### `nuxt`

Good for showing anything Nuxt relates. 

Preinstalled modules:
- `@vueuse/nuxt`
- `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss`

### `vue-vite`

Best for creating single-page Vue projects with just a single home route. Good for showing different Vue features in isolation.

Preinstalled: 
- `@vueuse/core`
- `tailwindcss`
