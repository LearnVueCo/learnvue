    <p>Vue.js (commonly referred to as Vue; pronounced "view"</p>

    <p>
      Vue.js features an incrementally adaptable architecture that focuses on
      declarative rendering and component composition. The core library is
      focused on the view layer only.
    </p>

    <p>
      Vue.js allows for extending HTML with HTML attributes called directives.
      The directives offer functionality to HTML applications, and come as
      either built-in or user defined directives.
    </p>

    <p>
      Vue was created by Evan You after working for Google using AngularJS in
      several projects. He later summed up his thought process: "I figured, what
      if I could just extract the part that I really liked about Angular and
      build something really lightweight."

    <p>
      When a new major is released ie v3.y.z, the last minor ie 2.x.y will
      become a LTS release for 18 months (bug fixes and security patches) and
      for the following 18 months will be in maintenance mode (security patches
      only).

      Vue components extend basic HTML elements to encapsulate reusable code. At
      a high level, components are custom elements to which the Vue's compiler
      attaches behavior. In Vue, a component is essentially a Vue instance with
      pre-defined options. The code snippet below contains an example of a Vue
      component. The component presents a button and prints the number of times
      the button is clicked:
    </p>

    <p>
      Vue uses an HTML-based template syntax that allows binding the rendered
      DOM to the underlying Vue instance's data. All Vue templates are valid
      HTML that can be parsed by specification-compliant browsers and HTML
      parsers. Vue compiles the templates into virtual DOM render functions. A
      virtual Document Object Model (or "DOM") allows Vue to render components
      in its memory before updating the browser. Combined with the reactivity
      system, Vue can calculate the minimal number of components to re-render
      and apply the minimal amount of DOM manipulations when the app state
      changes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Vue users can use template syntax or choose to directly write render
      functions using hyperscript either through function calls or JSX.
    </p>

    <p>
      Vue features a reactivity system that uses plain JavaScript objects and
      optimized re-rendering. Each component keeps track of its reactive
      dependencies during its render, so the system knows precisely when to
      re-render, and which components to re-render.

    <h2>Single Page Applications</h2>
    <p>
      A traditional disadvantage of single-page applications (SPAs) is the
      inability to share links to the exact "sub" page within a specific web
      page. Because SPAs serve their users only one URL-based response from the
      server (it typically serves index.html or index.vue), bookmarking certain
      screens or sharing links to specific sections is normally difficult if not
      impossible. To solve this problem, many client-side routers delimit their
      dynamic URLs with a "hashbang" (#!), e.g. page.com/#!/. However, with
      HTML5 most modern browsers support routing without hashbangs.
