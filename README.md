# LearnVue

The content for LearnVue's website and videos.

## How It Works?

The `content` folder is a [Nuxt Layer](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/layers) that is then used by the LearnVue Website (private repo). It contains the Markdown content for the long-form content on the Website.

The `demos` folder contains the source code for the examples used in the tutorials and videos. These apps are deployed to enable the preview embeds on the website.
