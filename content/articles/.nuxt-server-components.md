Nuxt Server components are a new experimental feature that allow us to build server-only components. This can help us improve performance and reduce bundle sizes.

You might be asking, isn't Nuxt already server-side rendered? Yes, it is. But Nuxt Server Components are different. 

To understand this better, let's first look at how typical Nuxt components work with SSR.

When a request hits your Nuxt app, the server runs your Javascript, generates the HTML, and sends it to the client. Since your app is server-side rendered, this initial HTML is already populated with data - which is what gives SSR the performance/SEO benefits it's known for.

Then, the client takes over and downloads/runs additional Javascript to make the page interactive. This process is called hydration and is what allows your components to be interactive. 

But this hydration step is one of the hottest topics in web dev right now because everyone's trying to figure out how to ship less Javascript to the browser, so the browser has less to download and run, and your Time to Interactive (TTI) is faster.

Nuxt Server Components can help us with this by letting us build components that don't ship any Javascript to the browser.

Let's look at an example.

## Server Components in Action

Let's say we have a regular Nuxt component that uses `markdown-it` to render a markdown string as HTML.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import MarkdownIt from 'markdown-it'

const md = new MarkdownIt()

const string = '# hello world\n\n- one\n- two\n- three'

const html = md.render(string)
</script>

<template>
  <div v-html="html"></div>
</template>

<style scoped>
div {
  color: #15ca82;
}
</style>
```

On our initial request...
1. This component will run on the server to generate the HTML
2. The HTML will be sent to the client
3. The client will download/run the Javascript to hydrate the component

This means that not only will our client need to download our component's Javascript, but it will also need to download `markdown-it` and any other dependencies. 

If we're running our app in `dev` mode, we can go to the Network tab and see requests both. `MarkdownComponent.vue` and `markdown-it`.

A better way to look at this is to run `npx nuxi analyze`. Here, we can see that a lot of our client bundle size is coming from `markdown-it` and its dependencies.

This is a lot considering that we're just using `markdown-it` to generate static content. We don't need it for any interaction.

So what if there was a way to remove our `MarkdownComponent` and its dependencies from our client bundle?

And this is where Nuxt Server Components come in.

First, we have to opt-in to this experimental feature in our `nuxt.config.js`.

```js
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  experimental: {
    componentIslands: true
  }
})
```

Then, all we have to do is change `MarkdownComponent.vue` to `MarkdownComponent.server.vue` to tell Nuxt that this is a server component.

Now, our app looks the same (because the HTML is still being generated on the server and Nuxt manages our styles). But in our DevTools, we no longer have requests for our server only component and its dependencies.

And if we run `npx nuxi analyze` again, we can see that our client bundle doesn't have that `markdown-it` section anymore - reducing the bundle size by a ton.

## Server Components + Reactivity

So now that we've seen a simple example of how Nuxt Server Components work, let's take a look at how it works when we start needing state.

Let's say we want to add a counter to our component. We can do this by using `ref` from Vue 3.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import MarkdownIt from 'markdown-it'

const md = new MarkdownIt()

const string = '# hello world\n\n- one\n- two\n- three'

const html = md.render(string)

const count = ref(0)
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="count++">Count: {{ count }}</button>
  <div v-html="html"></div>
</template>

<style scoped>
div {
  color: #15ca82;
}
</style>
```

This doesn't work. If we click our button, nothing happens because our client doesn't have any of the component's Javascript. So our browser has no concept of `count` and doesn't listen for the event listener on our button.

While this means server components can't manage state in this way, they can accept props. 

So if we moved our counter logic to a parent component that passed a `count` prop to our `MarkdownComponent.server.vue`, we could use that prop when we render our initial HTML.

#first

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const count = ref(0)
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="count++">increment</button>
    <MarkdownComponent :count="count" />
  </div>
</template> 

```

#second

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import MarkdownIt from 'markdown-it'

defineProps<{
  count: number
}>()

const md = new MarkdownIt()

const string = '# hello world\n\n- one\n- two\n- three'

const html = md.render(string)
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <p>Count is {{ count }}</p>
    <div v-html="html"></div>
  </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
div {
  color: #15ca82;
}
</style>

```

::

Now if we click our button, we can see that our `Count is {{ count }} ` paragraph (that's rendered by our Server Component) is updating. And if we look at our `Network` tab, we can see that everytime we click our button, a new request is made to the server that contains our updated HTML.

So with Server Components, whenever props change, we send a request to the server to re-render our component with the updated props and send the HTML to the client.

I still think Server Components are best used for components that don't need to be interactive or don't update much. But if you need to this behavior, it's possible.

## These are still experimental

Nuxt Server Components are still experimental and there are some limitations and features that are not yet supported.

### Must be synchronous

Currently, there's a known issue that causes a hydration mismatch if you have an async Server Component.

### No support for slots

Server Components don't support slots yet, but it sounds like that's a future feature that the Nuxt team will add when Server Components are more mature.

### Interleaving client and server components

From what I've tested so far, if you have a Server Component, you can't have a Client component with interaction inside of it. I've seen some diagrams from React and Next's implementation that show how they can do this, but when I tried to do this in Nuxt, it didn't work. 

### Remote sources in the future?

A really cool possible future feature that I've seen on Nuxt's GitHub issues is the ability to use remote sources for Server Components. This would allow multiple apps to use an endpoint that generates the HTML for a server component. There's a ton of possibilities for this so it's something I'll keep an eye on and make follow up content as it develops.

## Conclusion

Despite being in it's early stages, there are some really cool things that Nuxt Server Components can do. This is something I wanted to get on your radar so you can start experimenting with it and see if it's something that can help you in your projects.
